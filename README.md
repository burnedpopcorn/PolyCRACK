# PolyCRACK
A Re-Upload of PolyCraft 1.0.0.25

## To Install Extension using the ZIP
1. Download the files by downloading the ZIP from the Releases Tab
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP (PolyCraft_1.0.0.25.zip)
3. Go to chrome://extensions/
4. Enable Developer Mode (you cannot play this game without it)
5. Click the ```Load Unpacked``` Button
6. Select the PolyCraft_1.0.0.25 Folder (NOT ZIP)
> DO NOT click into the folder or anything inside, just select solely the folder

After that, it should be installed and can be accessed by opening the App Drawer and Opening the PolyCraft App

## To Install Extension using the CRX
> ZIP is recommended, because CRX usually fails
1. Download the CRX from the Releases Tab
2. Do steps 3-4 from the ZIP instructions
3. Open your Computer's File Manager
> You still need to keep the ```chrome://extension``` tab open and on screen, even if only partially

4. Drag and Drop the CRX file onto the ```chrome://extension``` tab

After that, it should be installed and can be accessed by opening the App Drawer and Opening the PolyCraft App

### Also "Source Code" Above
If you reeeaaallllly want to, you can pain-stakingly modify it to do things like remove ga.me and micro-transactions, or maybe even replace the micro-transactions screen with a cheats screen i guess.

You can do anything with Source Code if you have patience and time ... an ungodly amount of free time. But that's what I call the 'Power of Unemployment'!

### Also Also
Was thinking about making a website to be able to play without extensions or Developer Mode, but the ```staticmax``` folder has 1802 FUCKING FILES, plus I think there is a extension-only component baked into this, so that's not happening anytime soon (by me, but then again, The POWER OF UNEMPLOYMENT!)

### Also "Source Code" Above
If you reeeaaallllly want to, you can pain-stakingly modify it to do things like remove ga.me and micro-transactions, or maybe even replace the micro-transactions screen with a cheats screen i guess.

You can do anything with Source Code if you have patience and time ... an ungodly amount of free time. But that's what I call the 'Power of Unemployment'!
